Instead of hacking around the missing feature-level hooks _in_ Cucumber,
we can leverage our familiar container tools from the _outside_!
<!--more-->

If you say "hell yea", you may want to skip over my mental ramp-up and
directly to my <<solution,proposed solution>>.

_Disclaimer:_ I do not have tons of experience with Cucumber.
This post is a distillate of layman-expert frustrations that I see mirrored in many places online.
There may be better solutions to the problem I\'m about to describe,
including using a tool more suited to the tests I want to write.

## The Problem

link:https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/[Gherkin]'s 
`+Feature+` is just ... not a first-class entity in 
  link:https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/[Cucumber]:
The steps you write in `+Background+` are simply copied down to every `+Scenario+`.
Same for the existing
  link:https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/#hooks[hooks]: 
they all trigger for each `+Scenario+`.
While that makes for a very simple and clear runtime model, it has its limits.

By far the biggest issue for me is _speed_.
I do not use Cucumber for glorified unit tests but for system-level tests;
any step may include file, database, or network I/O.
Thus, shared test setup is crucial:
Even in my tiny hobby project, I run >100 scenarios.
If setup takes just 1s (it\'s more), that amounts to >99s overhead -- for ~30s of tests!

Of course, balancing test isolation versus execution speed is a problem inherent to testing,
and not at all exclusive to Cucumber.
Bridging the gap between declaring intent and executing tests _is_ a problem that every testing framework struggles with.
That said, Cucumber seems to specifically prevent building bridges over that gap, and
maintainers of Cucumber are on record saying that, no, this is as intended,
and if you have this problem you are using it wrong (e.g.
  link:https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/issues/678#issuecomment-43198445[here]).

Well.


## Possible Hacks

Coming from frameworks like JUnit, us developer types are used to something like a
`+BeforeAll+`/`+AfterAll+` hook pair scoped to files, classes, or a similar unit of grouping; 
Cucumber (only) has the equivalent of `+BeforeEach+`/`+AfterEach+`. 
Lifting this to `+BeforeAll+` is not too hard by making the hook idempotent:

```ruby
Before do
  if setup_needed?
    perform_setup
  end
end
```

I actually prefer to make the setup explicit in Gherkin `+Background+`,
so I did

```ruby
Given 'set up' do 
  if setup_needed?
    perform_setup
  end
end
```

This has the added benefit of being able to pass feature- and/or scenario-specific values 
(note how `+Before+` can not even access the scenario, let alone the feature!) 
and providing more opportunity for modularization and re-use than hooks.

Now, if `+setup_needed?+` is significantly faster than `+perform_setup+` 
-- a global property could be used, if all else fails --
this solves the setup cost problem.

But how do we tear down a setup in an orderly way so the next `+Feature+` can start from scratch?
There is not even an equivalent to `+Background+` in Gherkin! 
Without slapping tear-down on "the last" scenario 
(preventing clear test documents _and_ parallel test execution)
either explicitly or counting, there does not seem to be a way.
The best the community has to offer seems to be:

```ruby
at_exit do
  tear_down
end
```

This goes directly to the Ruby kernel, though, and can not be controlled per feature.


## Interlude: Wrapping Cucumber

After writing the _next_ section, I realized I needed to get an intermediate case out of my brain:
If Cucumber does not support isolating features, we can sure help it along:

```bash
for f in features/*.feature; do
  cucumber "$f"
done
```

Now, the workarounds mentioned above _do_, kinda, work per feature.
If setup and tear-down are feasible (or preferable) to do outside of the test framework,
one might even go one step further:

```bash
setup/before_all.sh

for f in features/*.feature; do
  feature=$(basename "${f}" '.feature')

  if [ -f setup/before_${feature}.sh ]; then
    setup/before_${feature}.sh
  fi

  cucumber "$f"

  if [ -f setup/after_${feature}.sh ]; then
    setup/after_${feature}.sh
  fi
done

setup/after_all.sh
```

And if you\'re not willing...

I for one do not appreciate moving test logic out of the test code. Smells.

## [[solution]]Isolation on Platform Level

I use Docker to run my tests in order to isolate them from my machine
-- each test may mess with my system, and I _really_ do not want to write `+after_all.sh+` --
so why not isolate features on _that_ level? Here goes (sketch):

```Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.5.8-slim-buster

WORKDIR app
COPY Gemfile ./
RUN bundle install \
 && rm Gemfile

COPY . ./
WORKDIR app/test
ENTRYPOINT ["cucumber"]
CMD []
```

Easy enough:

```bash
docker build -t my-project-tests -f test/Dockerfile . \
  && docker run --rm my-project-tests
```

I tied this into IDEA and I do not perceive any overhead;
rebuilding the last few layers after code changes is blazing fast.
For reference, in my case this `+docker run+` runs about ~55s.
Now, looping like above _does_ add some overhead:

```bash
for f in features/*.feature; do
    docker run --rm my-project-tests "$f"
done
```

This ran for ~75s.
I attribute most of that to one scenario having to actually set up something it would "borrow" in a single run;
that is, the cost here is from isolation, not using Docker.
Indeed, moving this shared setup to `+Dockerfile+`, I get ~38s for both single and loopy run!

### Summary

So what does this give us?

* Runs of the individual features are perfectly isolated (up to shared resources outside of the containers, of course):
** No `+after_+` hooks/scripts necessary beyond scenario level, at all.
** Neither dependency nor impact on the host machine.
** No accidental interference between tests.
** Features can be tested in parallel by default. Indeed:
+
```bash
for f in features/*.feature; do
    docker run --rm my-project-tests "${f}" &
done
wait < <(jobs -p)
```
+
drops the above down to ~18s, with ~15s being the longest individual run! +
(This is on my Linux machine with #cores > #features, so YMMV.)
* (Shared) Setup can be moved to (base-)image build time.

I think this approach has quite some potential!
One can easily imagine having one `+Dockerfile+` per feature and/or
using other sub-setting features of Cucumber to fine-tune the trade-off between isolation and running time even further.

The biggest challenge, I expect, is clarity: 
Ideally, we would _see_ all setup in the Gherkin files;
as far as it is relevant on the behaviour/domain level, anyway.
Maybe, with some experience, a container-driven runner for Cucumber could be built?
