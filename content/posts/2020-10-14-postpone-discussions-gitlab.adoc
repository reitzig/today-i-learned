As a professional nitpicker,
I open a lot of comment threads in reviews.
Usually, several of them have merit but have to be postponed;
a new ticket has to be created.
What a chore!

GitLab has a useful, if rather hidden function to create a new ticket for all open threads:

It would be even more useful if we could select a subset of threads --
but it\'s certainly better than nothing!
