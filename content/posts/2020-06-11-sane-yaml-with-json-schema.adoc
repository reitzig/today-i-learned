Most popular CI/CD systems use YAML as input language for their pipelines.
Debugging pipelines is always annoying due to long feedback cycles,
but I get particularly upset if the reason for failure is malformed YAML.

How do I stay sane?

Lucky for me, there is
  link:https://json-schema.org/[JSON Schema].
More to the point,

 - there are
     link:https://www.schemastore.org/json/[schemas for many popular interfaces],
 - they apply to YAML without changes, and
 - Jetbrains built
     link:https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/json.html#[first-level support]
   into their IDEs.

Here is what that looks like for
  link:https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions[GitHub Actions workflows]
as just one example.

. Open your Most Painful YAML and notice a small, innocuous label at the bottom:

+
It is _actually_ a button -- click it!
+
TIP: If you don\'t see this, link:img/2020-06-11-json-schema-for-yaml-6.png[check your settings].

. Start typing the type of thing at hand and see if a schema is available:

. Visit the Schema Mappings dialog to add custom schemas and
fine-tune your configuration:

+
Note how I told IDEA to match all files in `+.github/workflows+` to the appropriate schema.

While by no means perfect -- especially if the published schema does not quite match what you need,
or is written badly -- there are some immediate benefits. Wrong indentation after copy-pasting?

Not the most obvious error message
-- thanks, everything-goes YAML syntax! --
but at least we know something is wrong!
We even get syntax completion and,
if the schema contains it,
inline documentation:

Very cool!
If anyone ever asks me why they should create schemas for their interface,
this here is one very concrete value I will point to.

CAUTION: In case you hadn\'t noticed:
         I do _not_ like YAML. It is a time-sink without end.
         Whoever decided that whitespace should be part of any formal syntax needs to be ... given a stern talking-to.
         And here it\'s even worse than, say, for Python,
         since almost any way to indent is valid YAML and means _something_!
         But the _structure_ needs to be just right for the consumer to accept it ...
