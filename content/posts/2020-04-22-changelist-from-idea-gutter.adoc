How do _you_ handle not committing these bits and pieces the reviewers do not want to see?

<!--more-->

Be it credentials or custom configuration for your local development environment:
Not all changes you make to files should be committed.

*Partial Commits*::
Staging resp. committing only parts of files is a useful feature of Git in that regard.
On the command line, add the `+-p+` option when staging or committing.
Good visual clients such as IDEA also support this.

One problems remains, though: you have to repeat the exclusion for every commit.

*Changelists*::
IDEA has this concept that seems almost redundant when using Git, but here it helps us.
You can think of them as similar to Git stashes, but a bit more flexible.
In this context, the important thing is that you can selectively exclude changes from commits,
even if you commit changes in the same file.

*Gutter UI*::
And this got me excited today: Whenever you click on the gutter stripe indicating a change,
you can move that chunk to a separate changelist.
This is way more robust than interactive commits:
I can decide not to commit a change _while working_,
and I can not forget later to exclude it.
