How do you get basic information about Docker containers in a script?
Neither `+docker ps+` nor `+docker inspect+` feel really neat -- 
one is a pain to parse,
the other is very verbose.
<!--more-->

If you are happy adding a dependency to your script, 
the ever more popular 
  link:https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[`+jq+`]
can do the job for you:

```bash
  docker inspect --format="{{.State.Running}}" my-container \
| jq .[0].State.Running
```

While `+jq+` is a useful helper to pick up,
this still feels a little off. 
Shouldn\'t Docker have something for us?

It does, indeed!
Despite the misleading name, 
  link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/inspect/[`+--format+`]
does the trick.

```bash
docker inspect --format="{{.State.Running}}" my-container
```

It is easy to see how you can cobble together whatever information you need from here,
in whichever arrangement.
If pain text gets too messy, you can also go back to JSON easily,
for instance like `+{{json .Config.Env}}+`.

[TIP]
====
In combination with `+watch+`, 
you can use `+--format+` with the different `+docker+` commands 
to create your favorite live Docker dashboard with only a few terminals!
     
When I work with containers, 
I usually have something like this somewhere to the side,
just to keep track of what has been accumulating:

Big screens and tiling window managers are very handy for things like this.
