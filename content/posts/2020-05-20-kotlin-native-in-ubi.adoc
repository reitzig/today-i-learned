Does Kotlin Native compile and run on RedHat\'s Universal Base Image (UBI)?
<!--more-->

First, why build your container image on top of UBI at all?
Well, it is apparently best practice on OpenShift, at least if you ask RedHat.
They can
    link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image[explain better].

Since Kotlin Native does not work in quite _any_ container
    -- to my knowledge, Alpine is currently not supported --
the question presents itself: will it run?

Turns out it does in the way you would expect:

.Dockerfile
```Dockerfile
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7/ubi:latest AS build

<install Java and Kotlin Native>

COPY hello-world.kt ./
RUN export PATH=kotlin-native-linux-${kotlin_version}/bin:$PATH \
 && kotlinc-native hello-world.kt -o hello-world

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7/ubi-minimal:latest AS run

COPY --from=build hello-world.kexe ./hello-world

CMD ./hello-world
```

[NOTE]
====
I skipped the installation of Kotlin Native here;
it is not as neat as one would wish.
Maybe there will be a `+yum+` package at some point.

The final image is quite small (~80MB), with only a single binary added to the base image --
which is, of course, the point of the exercise.

Proof of life:

```text
$ docker build -t ubi-knative-demo . \
    && docker run --rm ubi-knative-demo
<snip>
Hello World, I'm Kotlin Native!
```

[CAUTION]
====
Building the `+build+` stage takes a while (~4min for me) and
the resulting image is huge (~2.9GB).
Docker does _not_ cache and clean up intermediate images in multi-stage builds very well,
so exercise caution lest you bury your system drive (like I did).

`+docker image prune+` is your friend.
