GitHub Actions is all about automating things.
Creating releases can include annoying manual work, though;
for instance, there is little out-of-the-box support for adding the correct assets and a meaningful description.
<!--more-->

Today I learned how to build a workflow that proceeds as follows.

. Triggered by semver-style tags,
. build Go binaries for multiple platforms,
. collect build artifacts,
. create a GitHub release with
. the relevant `+CHANGELOG+` section as description, and
. attach an archive with binary, license, and README for each target platform.

I will explain the most relevant parts with snippets below;
find the full workflow I created 
    link:https://github.com/reitzig/container-do/blob/f687b3c25ac941dfcbb692aef3bc62518c77d33f/.github/workflows/release.yml[here].


## Building Many Binaries

We can use a
    link:https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow#configuring-a-build-matrix[build matrix]
as a convenient way to build different combinations of binaries:

```yaml
build:
  runs-on: 'ubuntu-18.04'
  strategy:
    matrix:
      target-os:
        - 'linux'
        - 'darwin'
        - 'windows'
      target-arch:
        - 'amd64'
```

It is important to note here that `target-os` and `target-arch` are my choice, not built-ins -- 
use whichever parameters your build requires!
We can use those names as variables in a step later on:

```yaml
- run: |
    go build -o my-app ./...

    version="${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/}"
    archive_name="my-app_${version}_${GOOS}-${GOARCH}"
    if [[ "${GOOS}" == "windows" ]]; then
      zip "${archive_name}.zip" my-app LICENSE README.md
    else
      tar -czf "${archive_name}.tar.gz" my-app LICENSE README.md
    fi
  env:
    GOOS: ${{ matrix.target-os }}
    GOARCH: ${{ matrix.target-arch }}
```


## Assemble Artifacts

By using a build matrix above, we have created many independent jobs.
When we create the release later, we do not see their respective file systems!
Therefore, we have to store the archives we created as
    link:https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts#uploading-build-and-test-artifacts[build artifacts].
Using action
    link:https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact[upload-artifact],
we can even collect all archives in a single artifact:

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: "Build Archives"
    path: 'my-app_*'
```


## Prepare Release

Now, in a separate job without a build matrix, we can assemble our release.
We will use the neat action
    link:https://github.com/marketplace/actions/git-release[git-release],
but some preparation is needed.
First, we download the build archives from the artifact store and 
create a list of all included files.

```yaml
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: "Build Archives"

- id: asset_names
  run: echo ::set-output name=LIST::$(ls my-app_*.{tar.gz,zip})
```

NOTE: This seems a little more cumbersome than necessary;
      I created
        link:https://github.com/anton-yurchenko/git-release/issues/24[a ticket].

Then, because I want to release tags of the form `+X.Y.Z-foo` as pre-releases,
another step to inspect the Git tag:

```yaml
- id: is_pre_release
  run: |
    version="${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/}"
    if [[ "${version}" =~ -.*$ ]]; then
      echo ::set-output name=IS_PRERELEASE::true
    else
      echo ::set-output name=IS_PRERELEASE::false
    fi
```

Note the use of
    link:https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions[workflow command]
`+set-output+` to persist information for a later step.


## Create Release

Finally, we can call the release action:

```yaml
- uses: docker://antonyurchenko/git-release:v3
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    DRAFT_RELEASE: "false"
    PRE_RELEASE: ${{ steps.is_pre_release.outputs.IS_PRERELEASE }}
    CHANGELOG_FILE: "CHANGELOG.md"
    ALLOW_EMPTY_CHANGELOG: "false"
    ALLOW_TAG_PREFIX: "true"
  with:
    args: "${{ steps.asset_names.outputs.LIST }}"
```

This does quite a few things automatically;
in particular, it will pull the description from our
    link:https://keepachangelog.com/en/[keep-a-changelog]-style
`+CHANGELOG.md+` (and fail if we forgot to add one).
