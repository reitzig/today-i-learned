I love the powerful LaTeX drawing package
    link:http://www.texample.net/tikz/[TikZ]
and use it whenever I can, 
in particular for creating SVGs.
Converting from PDF to SVG with
    link:https://inkscape.org/[Inkscape]
usually gives good results, visually -- 
but what if the _structure_ of the XML is important, as well?

For example, you may want to manually tweak the arrangement of certain elements in Inkscape.
For this, it is important that SVG groups are meaningful or at least not harmful.
Unfortunately, as I describe
    link:https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/549739/3213[on tex.SE],
the `+lualatex+`+Inkscape pipeline can create pathological group arrangements that are a pain to work with.

    link:https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/549798/3213[reminded me] 
of the `+dvilualatex+`+`+dvisvgm+` pipeline.
Given that
    link:https://dvisvgm.de/[`+dvisvgm+`]
has specifically been developed to consume LaTeX-generated files,
it is certainly worth a shot!

And indeed, we can instrument the DVI by inserting special LaTeX commands in the source:

```latex
\special{dvisvgm:raw <g id="My Group">}
% any code
\special{dvisvgm:raw </g>}
```

The intermediate DVI looks just the same, but now `+dvisvgm+` knows to inject the given SVG snippets into its output.

TIP: Some tweaking of the `+dvisvgm+` call may be necessary depending on your document.
     For instance, I needed to add `+--no-fonts+` to force it to convert text into SVG paths
     instead of trying to include the font, which did not work in my setup.
