Navigating Slack efficiently is not as bad as I thought.
<!--more-->

I already knew about kbd:[Ctrl + K] to jump to a channel or chat,
and about kbd:[Ctrl + F] for search.
But something still felt off: jumping between chats was more awkward then I expect.

Now I discovered these subtle buttons:

And they even inform me that I can use kbd:[Alt + ←] resp. kbd:[Alt + →] to navigate through my history -- neat!
