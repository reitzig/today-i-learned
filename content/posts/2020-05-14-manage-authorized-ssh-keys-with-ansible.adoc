Authorizing SSH keys with Ansible is made easy by the `+authorized_key+` module.
Or is it?
<!--more-->

In the most simple case, we just want to authorize a single key, say the one of the current user:

```yaml
- name: Authorize me
  authorized_key:
    user: "john_doe"
    key: "{{ lookup('file', lookup('env','HOME') + '/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
    state: present
```

Now, in our project we wanted to authorize multiple team members for a shared account,
potentially with differences between hosts.
So we put public keys in the playbook repository and did something like this:

```yaml
- name: Authorize team
  authorized_key:
    user: "team_doe"
    key: "{{ lookup('file', item) }}"
    state: present
  with_fileglob:
    - "config/{{ inventory_dir | basename }}/ssh_keys/*.pub"
```

This is nice, but has a fatal flaw:
We do not de-authorize keys when we remove them from the playbook!
In case of a single key, we would solve this by adding `+exclusive: true+` but, alas,
this is

This option is not loop aware, so if you use `+with_+`, it will be exclusive per iteration of the loop.
If you want multiple keys in the file you need to pass them all to key in a single batch as mentioned above.

Therefore, we have to concatenate the key files.
We could do this up-front and have only a single file with all keys in the playbook,
but we prefer one file per key for transparency and maintainability reasons.
Lucky for us, there we can also
    link:https://stackoverflow.com/a/41843308/539599[assemble a multi-line string inline]:

```yaml
- name: Authorize team
  authorized_key:
    user: "team_doe"
    key: |
      {% for filename in lookup('fileglob', 'config/{{ inventory_dir | basename }}/ssh_keys/*.pub', wantlist=true) -%}
      {{ lookup('file', filename) }}

      {% endfor %}
    state: present
    exclusive: true
```

Note the extra empty line in the `+for+`-loop which translates into a line-break in the resulting string.

CAUTION: The output of `+ansible-playbook+` does not seem to indicate that it removed any keys from the server.
         You may want to check separately that the desired effect was achieved.
